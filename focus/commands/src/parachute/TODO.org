* TODO [bazel] Bazel simultaneous startup bug
  Bazel fails to write a temp dir when it is started by multiple
  threads in quick succession. On macOS, this is relatively easy to
  reproduce. This probably has to do with Twitter's source wrapper
  script, which IIRC uses mktemp with directories -- dangerous!
